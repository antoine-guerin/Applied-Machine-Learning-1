This is a machine learning project:
-warm-up: Solve a set of short tasks on synthetic data sets.
-House prices: Predict house prices using a real data set with 2 930 observations and 82 variables.
 
Projects are described in the task repository. I use a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) environment. My comments are included in the code.
